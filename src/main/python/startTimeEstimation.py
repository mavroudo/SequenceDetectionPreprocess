    This script reads a file with sequences of activity instances and their end-time timestamps, and creates a dict with the following schema:
        *   key = trace index: int
        *   value = array<struct<event_type: str, start_timestamp: datetime, end_timestamp: datetime, resourse: str>>

    We define concurrency of two activity instances (a.k.a. tasks) as described in the paper "Split Miner:
    Discovering Accurate and Simple Business Process Models from Event Logs" (Augusto et al. 2017, https://kodu.ut.ee/~dumas/pubs/icdm2017-split-miner.pdf).
    Tasks A and B are concurrent iff:
        *   there are 2 traces in log L such that in one trace A is directly followed by B, and in the other trace B is directly followed by A.
        *   there is no trace in log L such that A is directly followed by B and B is directly followed by A.
        *   the ratio (| |A->B| - |B->A| |) / (|A->B| + |B->A|) is less than 1.

    The start time of an activity instance (task) is determined in two phases as described in the paper "Repairing Activity Start Times
    to Improve Business Process Simulation" (Chapela-Campa, Dumas 2017, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12224.pdf):
        1.  Calculate the enablement time of the tasks based on the concurrency of the tasks.
            The enablement time of a task is defined as:
            *   the pre-defined trace start time, if the task is first in the trace.
            *   the end time of the last previous task in the trace, if the task is not first in the trace and that last previous task
                is not concurrent with it.
        2.  Fix the enablement time of the tasks based on the resource availability.
            The start time of the task is defined as the maximum of: the enablement time of the task, and the end time of the last task
            of the same resource which is previous to its end time.
