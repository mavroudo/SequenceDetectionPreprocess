object ExtractPairs {


  /**
   * Extracts the event type pairs from an RDD that contains the complete traces. If there are previously indexed pairs
   * this process will only calculate the new event type pairs by utilizing the information stored in the LastChecked
   * table. Additionally, there will be no event type pair where the two events will have greater time difference than
   * the one described by the parameter lookback.
   *
   * The generated pairs follow a Skip-till-next-match policy without overlapping in time. That is, in order to be two
   * occurrences of the same event type pair in a trace, the second one must start after the first one has ended.
   * For example: the trace t,,1,, = (a,b,c,a,b) contains 2 occurrences of the event type (a,b). However, the trace
   * t,,2,, = (a,a,c,b,b) only contains one occurrence of the previous event type pair.
   *
   * @param singleRDD The RDD that contains the complete single inverted index
   * @param last_checked The loaded values from the LastChecked table (it should be null if it is the first time that
   *                     events are indexed in this log database).
   * @param intervals The list of the intervals
   * @param lookback The parameter that describes the maximum time difference that two events can have in order to
   *                 create an event type pair.
   * @return Two RDDs: (1) The first one that contains all the extracted event type pairs and (2) the second one contains
   *         the last timestamp of each event type pair for each trace.
